#include<stdarg.h>
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Conch shell is a command programming language that executes commands read from a terminal or a file.
.LP
.B Converstion Specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.LP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation. The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.  The default precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.LP
.B c
If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.  If an l modifier is present, the wint_t (wide character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence by a call to the wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state, and the resulting multibyte string is written.
.LP
.B s
If no l modifier is present: The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written. If a precision is given, no null byte need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.
.LP
.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.
.LP
.B RETURN VALUE
